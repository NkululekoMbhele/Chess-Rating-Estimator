                        <p>I am just a normal person with a deep interest in things that are related to technology. I am
                            not quite sure what causes this burning interest in tech because I did not grow up around
                            computers or tech-savvy environment. I grew up in a small township KwaDabeka which is
                            located northwest of Durban City, South Africa. The only factor that directed me towards the
                            things that I am doing right now is the BSc Computer Science that I am currently trying to
                            obtain in the University of Cape Town. The thing that I like about myself is that I like to
                            learn new stuff more often due to that I have learned many skills using online resources, 3D
                            modeling, Photography, Video Editing, and Graphic Design.</p>

                    <div class="screen-body-item center">
                        <p>I always wanted to have a blog that I manage but I was unsure whether I am capable of
                            learning to make one. The one big thing that made me to not start a blog is the thought that
                            a blog has to be started by someone who has good writing skills and good English and with a
                            lot of knowledge in a particular topic. Unfortunately according to my thought, I was not the
                            kind of person capable of starting his blog. What made me start it so? you may be asking
                            yourself that question the thing that I just told myself is that starting the blog doesnâ€™t
                            matter if it perfect or not. And I had nothing to lose so I told myself that if I failed I
                            would have learnt a lot and if I succeed then cheers to that.</p>

                        <p>This blog is all about producing content related to technology. I have decided to share what
                            I have learned about programming, computers, mobile phones the internet, and also other
                            useful tech solutions and information. I may not be an expert in the field but I believe
                            that the slight knowledge that I have might be useful to someone without even a bit of it.
                            My goal and mission are to also inspire young South African to learn to use the internet to
                            share helpful and educational information especially the African community. I believe that
                            anyone can learn to make websites, mobile apps and other tech skills without even having a
                            school qualification. With the right resources, opportunities are endless. </p>
